# Practical 3

In practical3.c, the area under a curve tan(x) is approximated through the Trapezoidal method; the range of area is from 0 to pi/3. The calculations are done through a combination of manual codes and loops. The real area of the curve (log(2)) is also calculated and printed to see whether the Trapezoidal approximation is different from it.

"-lm" needs to be added to the compilation line to run.
