# Practical 7

 In practical7.c, the library <stdlib.h> is used for the function malloc(). The code's purpose is to estimate the value of e (e=2.71828...) based on a series. User input is needed to determine the order of polynomials to use, and the maximum order is 15 in the code. It also contains a function that computes the factorial of its argument, and uses changing values in a loop to run.
