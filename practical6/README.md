# Practical 6

practical6.c contains a code that computes the multiplication of two matrices (A and B). The matrix definitions and number of rows and columns are provided in the code, and can be modified. The coded uses a series of nested loops to go through each element of the matrices to create the product matrix (C). All 3 matrices are printed out at the end of the code to allow for double checking of the code's accuracy in calculation; based on provided parameters, the code is accurate in its calculation.
